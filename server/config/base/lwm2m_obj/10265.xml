Alarm Only (1)  for this mode no detailed frequency data is provided to the LwM2M server and an alarm is raised if the Leakage Detection Daughter board indicates that leak was detected. 
Top Frequency Values (2)  for this mode, only the top (Top Frequency Count) values will be delivered to the LwM2M server via the Frequency Value Resource
All Frequency Values(3)  for this mode, all frequency values for all frequency bands will be provided to the LwM2M server via the Frequency Value Resource

As an example if the frequency threshold for band 7 and band 52 needs to be overridden, then this resource should just contain those two values:-
/TBD/0/4/7 = 123
/TBD/0/4/52 = 345

In Detection Mode 2 (Top Frequency Values) only the number of values configured in Top Frequency Count will be provided. As an example, if the Top Frequency Count is 3 and the top three frequency threshold deviations were on band 8, 44 and 101, this resource would present:-
/TBD/0/5/8 = 434
/TBD/0/5/44 = 39
/TBD/0/5/101 = 349
In Detection Mode 3, this resource would present all frequency readings from 1 through to the number of bands measured by the board.
This resource can either be observed by the LwM2M server (and subsequently notified by the Client daily) or Read adhoc from the LwM2M server.
